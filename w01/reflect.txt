1. By completing this workshop I have learned how to print in c language. I have also learned how to compile files using a SHH. I have also learned how to submit my assignments using putty which is a SHH client and also to transfer my files using WinSCP which is a SFTP client.
2. A SHH is a network protocol which stands for secure shell and which is used to establish a secure connection between a user and a server. I have used putty which is a SHH client and I have used it to compile my program and by which I have used to submit my assignment. 
3. A SFTP is a secure file transfer protocol which stands for secure file transfer protocol which is used to transfer files between the users. I have used WinSCP which is a SFTP client and I have used it to transfer two of my source files which includes w1p1.c and w1p2.c.
