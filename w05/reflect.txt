1. The main advantage of using user defined types (structure) is that it helps us to group or organize a large group of variables under a single name or unit thus helping us to locate and understand our program better.
Eg. pi.number_of_lives, pi.number_of_tresure is stored under a single unit named as pi. Hence it makes us easier to locate such a variable in the program and then make the necessary changes to it.
2. The major changes that one would have to make to enhance the history of game plays and the endgame result is that we must change the definition of the object of the structure into an array. That is player_info pi[array size];, where the array size would be the number of times that we would like to save the history of the game plays. We should also declare a new array in the player_info structure to store the endgame results. 
3. This workshop was a bit confusing when I began working on it but gradually, I was able to understand it. The most challenging part that I had to overcome was in defining the arrays. Initially I had initialized them as a 2D array but later I had difficulties in comparing each index with the position that the user had entered so I had to change the array to single dimensional array. Thus, it was much easier to compare to the position entered by the user.
